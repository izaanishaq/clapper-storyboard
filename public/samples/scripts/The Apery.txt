INT. LAVINGTON GALLERY - DAY

    Ethereal HEIST MUSIC builds the atmosphere as we are ushered
    through the neoclassical facade of the esteemed Lavington
    Gallery.

    The high glass ceiling bathes the space in ANGELIC LIGHT.
    Patrons stand in hushed reverence, their eyes reflecting the
    bold colors of priceless masterpieces.

    We TRACK past tall Greek columns, over the polished concrete
    floor, towards a group of COLLEGE STUDENTS.

    They mingle indistinctly in the crowd, feigning interest in the
    art. Their eyes, however, tell a different story.

                                                  CUT TO:

    A SECURITY CAMERA panning lazily over the room.
    Its RED LIGHT blinks matter-of-factly.

                                                  CUT TO:

    Various CLOSE-UP shots of the students' eyes, each pair
    absorbing every inch of the space, calculating, memorizing.

    Among them, we find LEON REYNOLDS, our mastermind. 
    He stands still, a sentinel amongst moving bodies.
    
    His eyes scan the artwork before seamlessly darting to the
    security measures enveloping them.

                            LEON'S INTERNALS (V.O)
              In every stroke, a story. In every gallery,
              a game. Art and theft, forever entwined.

    As Leon's VOICE whispers, his hands, BARELY VISIBLE to the casual
    observer, sketch quick diagrams in a small, leather-bound
    JOURNAL.
    
    His stubble catches the light, a testament to the sleepless
    nights he's endured for this.

                                                  CUT TO:

    A discreetly positioned MAYA SANTOS, jots down notes on a gallery
    guide, her warm hazelnut eyes flicker with intense focus,
    betraying the mischievous gleam hidden within.

                            MAYA
                  (to herself, sotto voce)
              Acrylic glaze, non-period canvas...
              fascinating.

    She tucks a loose strand of bronze hair behind her ear, revealing
    a STUDDED EARRING, each precisely like the security cameras in
    design.

    PANNING across the room, we find SASHA HOFFMAN, her platinum hair
    an icy contrast to the warmth around her.
    
    She pensively examines a CLIMATE CONTROL PANEL near a series of
    Impressionist paintings.

                           SASHA
                  (under her breath)
              Airflow patterns... helpful, very helpful.
                  (a beat, then to her watch)
              And forty-eight hours of continuous recording.
              Excellent.

    Her sharp gaze fixes on a passing security guard, unnoticed under
    her feigned interest in a canvas brushstroke.

    ROTATING our view, ANTHONY LAMBERT flashes a charming smile to a
    TOUR GUIDE while pocketing a folded GALLERY MAP – oblivious, the
    guide blushes and giggles, her back to a 'STAFF ONLY' door he's
    just surveyed.

                           ANTHONY
                  (in French-accented English)
              Your knowledge is as enchanting as the art
              itself.

                                                  CUT TO:

    TESS WILLIAMS, at the edge of the crowd, her hoodie shadowing
    her face, she surreptitiously plugs a THIN CABLE into a hidden
    data port beneath a digital guidepost.

                           TESS
                  (whispering to herself)
              You're a beauty, aren't you? Let's see what
              secrets you hold.

    Her fingers DANCE over a mini-keyboard tucked in her sleeve as
    she reclines against the post.

                                                  CUT TO:

    The STUDENTS reconvene with practiced indifference. Their body
    language casual, but their faces severe with intent.

    Leon gazes intensely at his troop.
    
    This is the moment where their plan teeters on the edge of
    becoming reality.

                           LEON
                  (quietly to the group)
              Remember, it's not just what you look at. It's
              what you see. Be precise. Be bold.
              Tonight, we prepare for the greatest performance
              of our lives.

    The students disperse, each cloaked in a newfound determination.

    Their clandestine surveillance mission a success, they exit the
    gallery unnoticed among the throng of visitors.

                                                  MATCH CUT TO:

EXT. LAVINGTON GALLERY - CONTINUOUS

    The imposing architecture shrinks away as the STUDENTS move out.

    We linger on the GALLERY EXTERIOR, where the waning sunlight
    casts long shadows across the majestic columns, foreshadowing the
    dark turn their lives are about to take.

                                                  FADE OUT

EXT. LAVINGTON GALLERY - NIGHT

    The gallery stands silent under the moonlight, the calm before
    the storm. We PULL BACK as the last of the workers trickle out,
    the grand art sanctuary shuts down for the night.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. THE ENCLAVE BAR - NIGHT

    A rustic hideaway contrasted against the elegant gallery we just
    left. Edison bulbs cast a warm glow over each surface.
    
    Faces are relaxed here, conversations muffled by the sound of
    JAZZ TRICKLING through the air.

    In a secluded corner, Leon and his team share a large booth
    characterized by deep reds and amber tones.
    
    They sit in hushed tones while ON-SCREEN CAPTIONS indicate their
    names next to them as they speak, grounding us in their world.

                            LEON
              This isn't just another job, it's our future
              at stake. Tonight, we need to be more than
              thieves...

                            SASHA
              Und artists?

    The team looks at each other, a silent acknowledgment of their
    double lives.

                            ANTHONY
                  (Smiling)
              Artists and magicians, mon amis.

    The apparent levity drops at the sight of VICTOR MORETTI's entrance.
    He's a silhouette against the dim lighting of the bar, approaching
    with a dangerous grace.
    
    The team's body language shifts, an instinctual reaction to the
    predator entering their midst.

                            MORETTI
                  (smiling disarmingly)
              I hope I'm not interrupting.

    Leon remains unflinching, locking eyes with Moretti.

                            LEON
              You are, but we both know you don't care.

    Moretti sits, uninvited.
    
    A WAITER approaches but is waved off with a subtle gesture by
    Moretti – no one is to overhear.

                            MORETTI
                  (leaning forward)
              I've got something that belongs to you...

    He reveals a FILE, sliding it across the table.
    Leon doesn't touch it, his eyes ice over instead.

                            MAYA
                  (sharply)
              Get to the point.

                            MORETTI
                  (savoring the tension)
              Each of your fingerprints on relics I now own.
              Interpol would love to see this.

    The group tenses. Risk now palpable, the stakes clear.
    
    A BEAT before Leon responds.

                            LEON
              And... what do you want?

                            MORETTI
              Lavington's "Vanishing Vistas" exhibition.
              Replace the collection with your charming replicas.

    Tess leans in, her defiant glare unwavering.

                            TESS
              And if we say no?

                            MORETTI
                  (smirking)
              Then your promising careers are vanishing vistas.

    Tess's fists clench, but Leon places a calm hand over hers.
    His control over the situation at the forefront.

                            LEON
              How long do we have?

                            MORETTI
              Six months. The clock starts now.

    He stands, leaving the file on the table.
    His final glance at them is one of certainty.
    As he exits, silence settles over their booth.

                            ANTHONY
                  (whispering)
              We're in too deep to swim back now.

                            MAYA
                  (lightly touching the file)
              So we dive deeper and come out on the other side.

                            SASHA
                  (nods, businesslike)
              A heist of this magnitude... it will require
              precision, und a perfect execution.

                            LEON
                  (with conviction)
             We will turn this gamble into our masterpiece…
             A true apery.

    The group nods in silent agreement, resolute despite the
    menace lurking in the backgrounds of their fates.
    
    They disband into the night, shadows embracing equal parts
    despair and determination.

    The team disperses into the shadows of the city, their
    MEASURED FOOTSTEPS a mantra against the cobblestone.

    The gallery looms in the distance - tomorrow it will become

INT. LEON'S SECRET WORKSHOP - NIGHT

    A stark contrast to the bar's homeliness, the workshop is an
    industrial cavern of secrets. Workbenches, canvases, tools,
    and machinery blanket the space - a chaotic order reigns here.

    A PROJECTOR throws blueprints of the Lavington Gallery onto the
    wall.
    
    The team, gathered around a large table strewn with plans and
    tech, exude a collective, focused intensity.

                            LEON
                  (points at the blueprint)
         Entry points, surveillance patterns, guard
         rotations - we need control over each. Tess?

                            TESS
         Already on it. I've infiltrated their system.
         With a few more tweaks, I'll have complete access.

    She reveals her COMPUTER SCREEN showing complex code cascading down.

    It mirrors against her determined eyes.

                            SASHA
         Und the security systems?

    Tess smirks, tapping a few keys.

                            TESS
         They'll be seeing what we want them to see.

                            LEON
                  (turning to Maya)
         The paintings?

                            MAYA
                  (brush in hand, working on a copy)
         Give me four months. They'll be aging like fine wine,
         indistinguishable from the real deal.

    She steps back, and we get a glimpse of her work - a near-perfect
    replica of a priceless piece.

    Leon shifts his attention to the detailed security schematics.

                            LEON
                  (to Sasha)
         Disabling?

                            SASHA
                  (clutching a petite but intricate device)
         I'll create something non-invasive, silent.
         It will take time, but it will be flawless.

                            ANTHONY
                  (product display on his tablet)
         And once they're down, I'm in.
         The distraction's all set.

    He shows a CREATIVE PRESENTATION for a forthcoming marketing event
    at the gallery that will coincide with their heist.

                            LEON
                  (exhales, pensive)
         Then let's begin. This gallery's gonna witness a vanishing
         act like no other.

    The team converges over the blueprint, their minds weaving a web of deception
    and precision. Each one, a vital thread, now interlaced into the intricate
    tapestry of their heist.

    A panoramic view of San Francisco's illuminated skyline; its
    twinkling lights casting reflections on the bay. The heist music's
    techno-influence throbs with an electric momentum.

INT. TESS'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT

    We reveal TESS WILLIAMS' digital dominion, a corner of calculated
    chaos.

    Surrounding her, a fortress of monitors pulse with the lifeblood
    of data streams.

    Heist music plays, the rhythm paralleling Tess's nimble dance
    across her keyboard.

    A wire labyrinth feeds into a command center of monitors,
    displaying an oscillating frenzy of code. Tess commands the
    chaos, focused like a virtuoso at her grand piano of cybernetics.

                            TESS
                  (self-assuring whisper)
         Okay, baby... let's show them how the digital world bows to us.

    Her fingers pirouette on the keyboard, a frenetic ballet in the blue monitor glow.

    INSERT – MONITOR SCREEN

    Complex algorithms spiral and converge, yielding ACCESS GRANTED notifications
    one after another.

                            TESS (CONT'D)
                  (with a satisfied nod)
         That's the chorus I've been composing.

    Tess swivels to a secondary workstation, a cockpit of scribbled code on neon
    sticky notes. Each keystroke implants deceptive ghosts into the gallery's network.

                            TESS (CONT'D)
         A splash of misdirection here, a sprinkle of mirage there…

    A toy dinosaur on her desk WOBBLES, a mechanism triggers, and it ROARS.
    Tess glances with mock annoyance.

                            TESS (CONT'D)
         I'm working, T-Rex. No prehistoric symphonies right now!

    She flicks the dinosaur. It grows silent. Tess laughs, her levity brief in the
    night's gravity.

                            TESS (CONT'D)
         As I prophesied...

    She meticulously crafts the gallery's virtual facsimile,
    embroidering her own network beneath the overt digital landscape.

    INSERT – ANOTHER MONITOR SCREEN

    A 3D wireframe maze of Lavington's security architecture morphs,
    highlighting Tess's clandestine pathways blossoming like digital flora.

    Her grimace turns to a grin as SCHRODINGER, her code name for
    unpredictability, the cat, jumps onto the desk, vying for
    attention amidst the high stakes.

                            TESS (CONT'D)
         Joining the fray, Schro? The more, the merrier.
         There's a big fish in the cyber sea tonight.

    She indulges the cat with a scratch, its nose accidentally
    toggling a virtual switch on the screen.
    
    The feeds shimmer and reshape, revealing dummy
    footage primed to cloak their movements.

                            TESS (CONT'D)
         You're officially on the team now, Schro.
         Sasha, your toys are cleared for the show.

    tiny automaton in her palm.

                            SASHA

    She meticulously screws the back panel of the device,

         Now for the sleight of hand...
         to disappear without a trace.

    She enters a command; onscreen representation of her digital
    footprint fades into the intricate web of her own making.

                  (with playful arrogance)
         The digital cloak of invisibility...
         still a classic in my collection.

    Satisfied, TESS leans back, a rare moment of introspection amid
    her electronic empire. Screens signal their readiness;
    the silence before the digital tempest.

                            TESS (CONT'D)
         Patience, my digital symphony.
         The opera is about to begin.
         Make us proud, Leon and comrades.
         It's almost showtime.

    She permits herself a smirk as the countdown clock hits zero.
    Tess's eyes sparkle – serene amidst the countdown.

    a canopy of tools laid out with surgical precision.

INT. SASHA'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT

    Each tool has its place in the sterile temple that is SASHA'S workspace.
    Shelves are lined with labeled components, organized to perfection.

    PANNING SHOT reveals Sasha huddled over a glass table,
    soldering a circuit on the tiny, spider-like drone she's perfecting.

         The Sentry's not just a device;
         it's the embodiment of deception.

EXT. VIADUCT UNDERPASS - NIGHT

    The van emerges beneath the underpass, its walls
    graffiti-tagged with the city's urban tattoo.
    
    A SHADOWY FIGURE watches from above, obscured by the darkness.
    As the van passes:

    The figure steps out to reveal MAYA, her earlier poise
    now masked by concentration.
    She pulls out a two-way radio.

         Hawk is in flight. Keep an eye on the egg.

    Tess maneuvers the van with agility, swerving past oncoming
    vehicles and pedestrians. The CAMERA JERKS and JOSTLES,
    mirroring the chase's chaotic energy.

                  (stressed)
         Hold on tight, this is gonna get bumpy!

    SASHA, sitting beside her, clutches a remote control with
    a RED BUTTON.
    
    She meets Tess's eyes, a silent query that's answered with
    a determined nod.

                            SASHA
                  (hurried)
         Ready on your mark!

    Suddenly, the sedan gains ground, its headlights looming
    ominously.
    
    Tess's eyes lock on the road ahead – a barricade of
    CONSTRUCTION SIGNS and flashing amber lights.
    
    She presses down on the accelerator, a surge of power
    pushing them onward.

    A pre-set DETONATION goes off behind them,
    sending a SHOWER OF SPARKS and DEBRIS into
    the path of Archer's pursuing sedan.
    
    The sedan SCREECHES to a halt.

EXT. ARCHER'S SEDAN - NIGHT

    Archer slams his hands on the steering wheel,
    frustration etched into every line of his face.

    He reaches for his radio again while eyeing the
    vanishing tail lights of the van.

                            ARCHER
                  (urgent, into radio)
         They've set a trap.
         I need aerial support and all units to converge on—

    He cuts off abruptly, as something catches his attention.
    A glint of LIGHT reflects off something in the distance,
    drawing his gaze.

                                                  ARCHER'S POV - THE SECOND VAN

    Sneaking through an intersecting street,
    the SECOND VAN takes a different, SECURER route,
    unnoticed by the chaos of the first distraction.

                                                  BACK TO SCENE

    Archer, realizing he's been duped, makes a quick decision.

                            ARCHER
                  (grim realization, into radio)
         Forget it. They split up. I'm going after the
         secondary target. Stay on the original!

    With swift precision, Archer shifts gears and U-TURNS his sedan,
    racing off toward his new objective. The divided pursuit now has
    multiple paths converging in the NIGHT.

    The distant SIRENS and chaos are drowned out by the RUSHING WATER

    He pulls out a discreet EARPIECE, speaking with quiet authority.

         The eagle has left the nest.
         I repeat, the eagle has left the nest.
         Rendezvous at point delta.

    A SIGH of relief passes his lips, visible in the cold night air.
    He turns from the scene, his silhouette receding into the urban
    tapestry as he makes his way toward their ultimate meeting place.

    MORETTI sits at his grand desk, a fortress of power and

    stillness shattered by the ARRIVAL of one of his trusted
    lieutenants, breathless, carrying a RADIO.

                            LIEUTENANT
                  (tense)
         Boss, the first van's been hit. There's been an incident.

    MORETTI's eyes narrow into slits, fury barely masked.
    He stands slowly, his demeanor calm but deadly.

                            MORETTI
                  (ominous)
         Then we play our hand. No one double-crosses Victor Moretti.

    He snatches the radio, barking orders.
    His men mobilize, a swarm of precision and ill intent flooding
    the room as he stalks toward the PANORAMIC WINDOWS, overlooking
    his city of sin.

    Inside, the mood is palpably tense.
    The van is filled with the REAL ARTWORKS, each one safely
    housed in protective casing.
    
    Maya sits with Leon, sharing a look that speaks volumes of
    their shared journey.

                  (reassuringly)
         We did it, Leon. We're almost there.

                  (sober, focused)
         Not until every piece is secured, and Archer's out
         of the picture. Keep your eyes open; it's not over yet.

    He checks the rear-view mirror, his caution a testament to the
    stakes at play. The van heads toward the edge of the city,
    where their FREEDOM – or downfall – awaits.

EXT. ABANDONED INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT - NIGHT

    The SECOND VAN winds through the desolate streets, flanked by
    DECAYING WAREHOUSES and FORGOTTEN FACTORIES.
    
    The pulse of the chase now a distant echo, they pull into a
    nondescript building shaded by darkness.

INT. SECOND VAN - CONTINUOUS

    LEON, behind the wheel, kills the engine.

    The silence is deafening.

    MAYA eyes the rearview mirror, vigilant for any sign of pursuit.
    Her fingers intertwine with Leon's, a quiet show of unity.

                            MAYA
         Just like old times, huh?

                            LEON

    The workshop door opens with a HISS, beckoning them into the
    belly of creativity and duplicity. The paintings are
    carefully carried inside, the tension palpable.

INT. WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS

    Surrounded by FORGED ART and TOOLS OF THE TRADE,
    the team deposits each piece onto a designated table.

    SASHA examines the locking mechanisms on the SHIPPING CRATES,
    ready to secure the precious cargo.

                            SASHA
         These need to be climate-controlled.

         Temperature and humidity are stable. It's time.

    They share a collective breath as LEON leads the way to the HEART
    OF THE WORKSHOP – a reinforced steel door, its exterior an
    incongruous mural of eclectic street art.

    Leon approaches a KEYPAD hidden within the mural, entering a

    a green light illuminating his face. It's done. They are now

    DETECTIVE ARCHER, driven by instinct and hard-won experience,

                  (talking to himself)
         They're close. I can feel it.

    His hand pauses over the radio before he retracts it, his eyes
    catching a fleeting SHADE disappearing around a warehouse
    corner. Curiosity piqued, he slows the car.

EXT. ABANDONED INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT - WAREHOUSE CORNER - CONTINUOUS

    Archer steps out of the vehicle, DRAWING his GUN with deliberate
    calm. His FOOTSTEPS echo as he advances towards the corner, the
    light from his flashlight cutting swaths through the night.

    A calculated tell? Or a genuine mistake?
    His grip tightens around the pistol, senses heightened.

    darkness beyond.

    Silence pervades the cavernous space, punctuated only by the

    He sweeps the BEAM OF HIS FLASHLIGHT across the room,
    uncovering nothing but dust and the remnants of previous
    occupancy – overturned chairs, rusty machinery.

                  (under his breath)
         They've got to be here.

    Suddenly, a CRACKING SOUND echoes through the emptiness.
    Archer swings around, the Glock ready in his hand.
    An elongated shadow stretches across the floor.

    Without warning, ANTHONY steps out from the shadows, his hands
    raised in mock surrender, a smirk playing on his lips.

                            ANTHONY
         Detective Archer, right?
         I was hoping we’d run into each other.

                            ARCHER
                  (aiming the gun)
         You're a long way from the gala, Mr. Lambert.
                  (tightens grip)
         Where's the rest of your crew?

    Anthony’s smirk never wavers as he inches closer into the light,
    his charisma seemingly unperturbed by the tense situation.

         Oh, you know, around.
                  (strategic playfulness)
         But they're not the company you're looking for.

    Archer's eyes narrow; he senses the game at play.

                            ARCHER
                  (cuttingly)
         Don't test me. I’m not in the mood for games.

                  (calmly)
         Isn't that exactly why we're here?
         A game of cat and mouse, though I'm not sure who's
         who anymore.

    Archer's grip on the Glock tightens. He motions with the barrel
    for Anthony to turn around and places handcuffs onto his wrists.
    
    A look of genuine surprise crosses Anthony's face, replaced

    Archer opens the rear door of the sedan. Before pushing Anthony

    feeling of unease settling in his stomach.
